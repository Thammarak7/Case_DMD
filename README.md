# Project_Case_DMD
Duchenne muscular dystrophy(DMD) Disease Bioinformatics 

## Description

This project, DMD Interaction, is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis tool for the interactions between small molecules and proteins associated with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Our aim is to facilitate the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in DMD and to aid in the identification of potential therapeutic targets. By aggregating data on gene expression, protein activity, and molecular interactions, the project serves as a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians in the field of neuromuscular disorders.
